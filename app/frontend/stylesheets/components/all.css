/*
  CSS components are CSS classes that have a semantic rather than stylistic name
  and are usually longer than a one-liner. They can be composed of multiple CSS rules.

  ie `.co-recensement-notes` is a component, while `.co-font-weight--bold` would rather be a utility.

  CSS Components should not match View Components, since View Components can embed their own isolated CSS.
  If the CSS component is a single short rule, it can go into `small_components.css`

  by default we should try to use only DSFR classes, or CO utilities, and CO Components should come last.
