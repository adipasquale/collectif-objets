/*
  utilities are one-line CSS classes that are very explicit like
  `.co-font-weight--bold { font-weight: bold; }`

  on the opposite `.co-recensement-notes` would rather be a CSS component

  by default utilities go in the `various_utilities.css` file.

  if a lot of them are about the same topic, they can be extracted into an isolated file
  for example flexbox classes are grouped in `flex.css`
